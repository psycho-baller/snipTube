00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
- In the last video,

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.660
I talked all about the window object

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.680
and how you can pretty much
just ignore it completely.

4
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.520
And in this video,

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.220
we wanna talk about the document object,

6
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.060
which is incredibly useful
all across programming

7
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.230
in the browser.

8
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.313
So to see exactly what
this document object is,

9
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.017
let's just console.log out document,

10
00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:17.820
and we just type in document.

11
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.824
This is exactly the same as
if we typed window.document.

12
00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.950
They're both the same thing we
can just use document though,

13
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.510
or window.document it's going
to print the same thing.

14
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.343
As you can see,

15
00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.298
it prints out this weird
like hashtag document.

16
00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:30.311
And when we open this up,

17
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:31.630
you're gonna see document

18
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.370
is essentially just all
of the html for our page.

19
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.800
You can see this is the exact HTML

20
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
of our entire page from
this index.html here.

21
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.463
So it's printing out the HML of our page

22
00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:43.479
and that's really useful

23
00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.900
because the document
allows us to get elements

24
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.733
from our HTML.

25
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.660
It allows us to modify our HTML,

26
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.658
create new elements to add into our HTML.

27
00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:54.375
It's really the way you interact
with the HTML of your page.

28
00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.450
So for example, if we wanna get the body,

29
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.157
we could say document.body,

30
00:00:58.157 --> 00:00:59.620
and this is going to give us

31
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.493
that body element of our document.

32
00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:04.620
We could also get for
example, document element,

33
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.925
and this is going to give
us just the HTML portion

34
00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:08.047
of our document.

35
00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.990
You can notice when we
had just document here,

36
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.586
it also gave us this doc type at the top,

37
00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.728
but if we just wanna get the HTML element

38
00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:16.530
and everything inside of it,

39
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.774
that's what document
element is used for it.

40
00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:21.350
Now, I also mentioned that
you can create elements

41
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.730
with document.create element.

42
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.563
So let's just come in here

43
00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:26.035
and we're gonna create a new element

44
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:29.101
and we're gonna set it equal
to document.create element.

45
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:30.410
And this is a function.

46
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.709
And all you do is pass
the name of the tag.

47
00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:33.777
So you can create, for example, a div

48
00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:35.738
or you can create a span,
whatever you want to create.

49
00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:37.883
We'll just create a
span here, for example.

50
00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:39.862
And then we can take our element.

51
00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:42.130
And if we wanna put some
text inside of this,

52
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.569
we'll say dot innertext,

53
00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.568
'cause now we have access to an element

54
00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:47.363
and to specify the
texts we say, innertext,

55
00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:50.570
and we'll just set it
equal to Hello World.

56
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.140
And now we just wanna add
that to our document body.

57
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.489
So we can say document.body,

58
00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.330
'cause this is where
we're gonna add this too.

59
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.880
We could say dot appendchild

60
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.810
and we pass in the element we want to add,

61
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.397
which in our case is this
element we just created.

62
00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:06.350
We're going to append it
to the end of the body

63
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.480
of our document.

64
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.312
We click save.

65
00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:09.458
You'll notice nothing gets printed out,

66
00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.410
but if I pull over the page,

67
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.820
you'll see that Hello
World has been appended

68
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.930
to the end of our document.

69
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.763
If I just shrink this down,

70
00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:16.930
so it's on the right side of our screen.

71
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.216
And I changed this to like,
Hello World 2 and save.

72
00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:21.643
You can now see it reruns
and re-adds this element

73
00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:23.523
with the text, Hello World 2.

74
00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:25.173
So this document is super powerful

75
00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:27.730
and is really the gateway into interacting

76
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.660
with everything inside of our browser,

77
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.530
creating elements, selecting elements,

78
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.360
adding events, modifying things,

79
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.582
it's all done through
this document object here.

80
00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:37.010
And in the next few videos,

81
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.450
I'm gonna explore all the different ways

82
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.670
you can use this document
object in more depth,

83
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.824
but this video was really just a precursor

84
00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:43.639
to what the document object is

85
00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.870
and how you can use it to
just create a simple element.

86
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.703
So in the next video,

87
00:02:47.703 --> 00:02:49.410
I'm gonna show you how you
can select elements using

88
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.220
their ID and their class
with this document object.

89
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.320
And I can't wait to see you in that video.
